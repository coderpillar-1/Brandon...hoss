<h1>Minecraft Pearl</h1>
<p>I recieved a copy of Minecraft for my PC on July second 2025, and I started playing right then.</p>
<p>The next day I went to Minecraft Mob Making camp and made a new ore block in MCreator.</p>
<p>Two days later I went back to camp and made a compressed block, ore ,and a really powerfull wepon all made out of Pearl.
</p>
<p>The day after that I went to camp and made a helmet, chestplate leggings, and boots for armor and they are super protective.</p>
<p>The next day I made my own biome based on the moon with Dolphins, Armadillos, Blazes, Villagers, Axlotols, Ender Dragons, Wither Skeltons Glow Squid, Iron Golems, and Chickens </p>
<p>I made a new ore and biome in Minecraft.</p>
