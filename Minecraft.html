<h1>Minecraft Pearl</h1>
<p>I recieved a copy of Minecraft for my PC on July second 2025, and I started playing right then.</p>

<p>The next day, I went to Minecraft Mod Making Camp.  The first thing I did was draw out my ore block, commpressed block, ore, weapon, and armor. Then I made then a new ore block in MCreator.</p>

<p>Two days later, I went back to camp and made a compressed block, ore, and a really powerfull weapon all made out of Pearl.
</p>
<p>The day after that, I went to camp and made a helmet, chestplate, leggings, and boots for armor and they are super protective. I also learned about commands.</p>
<p>Here is a story about playing Minecraft that day: Using commands, I transported to a village next to a cliff and walked into a Villager's house and looked into a Villager's chest. I found some emeralds, and I took them. Later I traded the emeralds with a Villager for a furnace, then I went over to the side of the cliff. </p>
<p>The next day, I made my own biome based on the moon with Dolphins, Armadillos, Blazes, Villagers, Axlotols, Ender Dragons, Wither Skeletons Glow Squid, Iron Golems, and Chickens. </p>
<p>To go to my biome I made a portal out of cobblestone and it can only be activated by my weapon.</p>
